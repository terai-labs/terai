**Terai** simplifies the process of translating messages in your JavaScript
application. You can use the `terai translate` command by setting up a
translator in your `terai.config.ts` file. This guide will walk you through the
steps to configure and use the translator effectively.

<Steps>

<Step>
### Translation config

First, you need to configure the translator in your `terai.config.ts` file.
**Terai** provides integrations with some major translation
service providers, or you can opt-in for configuring a custom translator.
Also, you need to set up the locale targets for which you want to generate translations.

```tsx
import { defineConfig, createGoogleCloudTranslator } from '@terai/dev'

const translator = createGoogleCloudTranslator({
  // your Google Cloud crendentials
})

export default defineConfig({
  outLocales: ['es-ES', 'ja-JP'],
  outDir: './locale',
  translator,
  // ...rest of options
})
```

In the above code snippet:

- Import necessary modules from `@terai/dev`.
- Use the `createGoogleCloudTranslator` function to set up the translator.
- Pass the translator to the Terai config.
- Define the target locales for which we want to generate translations.

</Step>
<Step>
### Running `extract`

Before you can generate translations, you need to run the `extract` command to
update all gathered messages from your project. This Step ensures that **Terai** has a
list of messages (dictionary) to translate.

```sh
pnpm terai extract
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Running `translate`

Once your translator is configured and sources messages are extracted, you can easily
manage translations by running the `translate` script. **Terai** will handle the
translation process and generate the necessary translation files according to the specified config.

```sh
pnpm terai translate
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

Whenever you run the `translte` command, **Terai** will execute the following steps:

1. Terai will gather all locale dictionaries, except from that defined as `projectLocale`.
2. The `cache` is checked, and a new dictionary with those non-translated messages will be created.
3. Each dictionary will be passed down to the `translator` function.
4. The translated dictionaries will be written to the `outDir` folder
